# üê¨ TDDD81 - SQL Database Technology

This repository contains my work for the course **TDDD81 - Database Technology** at Link√∂ping University, which I attended in Spring 2024. The primary focus is on **Laboration 4 - Brian Air**, a larger project where I implemented a relational database to manage a fictional airline, Brian Air, based on a given set of requirements.

## Project Overview
The goal of the project was to design and develop a flight booking system, showcasing the practical application of relational database concepts. The project was written in **SQL**.

[**Assignment4b_BrianAir_REVISED.pdf**](./Assignment4b_BrianAir_REVISED.pdf) - Structure of the relational database, including tables, relationships, and constraints used to implement the flight booking system.

[**brian_air.sql**](./brian_air.sql) - SQL code for creating and populating the relational database for the Brian Air project, implementing the flight booking system as per the specified requirements.
